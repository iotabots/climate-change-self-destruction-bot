# Climate Change Self Destruction IOTABOT

The first IOTABOTS action against climate change. 

This robot IOTABOT the NASA annual report about the [Land-Ocean Temperature Data](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/graph_data/Global_Mean_Estimates_based_on_Land_and_Ocean_Data/graph.txt). If the average temperature increase over 2 degrees Celsius - everyone can press the "self-destruction" button and the IOTABOT will just disapear in the dark - without any special effects or animations. Let's hope and do everything we can do, that this will never happen!
